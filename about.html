							scrolling through social media, binging anime, or
							just vibing with some good music. I believe in
							continuous learning and always strive to improve my
							skills.</p

						<h2>Note to future self</h2>
						<p
							>Hey future Ebuka! Remember why you started this
							journey. You wanted to become a better developer,
							not just for the money, but because you genuinely
							love creating things that matter. Don't let imposter
							syndrome get the best of you. Every expert was once
							a beginner. Keep pushing, keep learning, and most
							importantly, keep building. The Ebuka of today
							believes in you!</p

						<h2>Extra thoughts</h2>
						<p
							>I'm really excited about this program because it
							represents more than just learning new technologies.
							It's about joining a community of like-minded
							individuals who are all working towards similar
							goals. I hope to not only grow technically but also
							personally through this experience. The journey of a
							thousand miles begins with a single step, and this
							is my step forward into becoming the developer I've
							always wanted to be.</p
